# Hotel-Management-System

This project presents a comprehensive Hotel Management System developed in Python, designed to streamline hotel operations and enhance user experience. The system incorporates object-oriented programming principles through the use of classes that handle key entities such as hotels and users. Data persistence is ensured through seamless integration with a MySQL database.

# Key Features:
# Hotel Sorting:
* Users can sort hotels based on various criteria, including:

* Name
